<h1 font-size="100px">Flash Chatâš¡</h1>
<h3>This app is an one-page chat with a capability to register and login the user.</h3>
<p>I added Firebase into this project (FirebaseAuth & FirebaseStore) using CocoaPods, so as to be able saving users and their messages. Also I added CLTypingLabel to make my title animated in the root ViewController of my project. Additionaly I included IQKeyboardManagerSwift using Swift Package Manager to make my keyboard looking well.</p>
